# Juroku

Juroku converts an image (PNG or JPG) into a Lua script that can be loaded as a
ComputerCraft API to be used to draw on terminals and monitors.

## Building and Running
1. A cgo security exception is required to allow the libimagequant to build:
```
export CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW=.*
export CGO_LDFLAGS_ALLOW=.*
```
2. `go get -u github.com/tmpim/juroku/cmd/juroku`
3. Find `juroku` in your `$GOPATH/bin` and run it.

TODO: Release pre-built binaries.
